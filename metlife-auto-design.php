				<p>MetLife was one of our insurance brand partners a couple of years ago. This site was designed to get user's to fill out a contact form or call directly into our sales center so we could sell them MetLife auto insurance. This was one of the first responsive websites I created.</p>

						<h1>Design Considerations</h1>
						<p>Finding unique imagery is one of the hardest parts of designing for multiple partners in the same industry. So many insurance companies use photos of happy families or young couples loading up the car for a road trip. As an attempt to break away from the expected, I decided to use imagery of the open road. I hoped it would convey a sense of freedom and independence to the customer. I wanted the consumer to subconsciously feel that that freedom could be gained by getting auto coverage through MetLife.</p>
