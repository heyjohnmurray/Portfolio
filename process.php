						<h1>Before we begin ...</h1>
						<p>I'm going to describe my process using a web app that I'm currently building with EmberJS. Although, I'm proud of this project, it doesn't show up in my portfolio because it's not complete. If you're interested in seeing the front end code for it, then <a href="https://github.com/heyjohnmurray/EmberApp">check it out on my github.</a></p>

						<h2>Step One: Initial Planning</h2>
						<h3>Define the problem</h3>
						<p>Every good application has a clear goal. Whether I'm redesigning a web site, designing a mobile app or designing a software application I always ask the same question: "What's the point?".</p>
						<p>In this case I decided to create an application that lets users track what food they have in their pantry. I do a lot of the shopping and meal planning in my family, and I feel like every time I go to the store I buy something I already had at home because I can't remember already purchasing it. This application was the brainchild born of that frustrating experience.</p>

						<h3>Describe the ideal user</h3>
						<p>Once I define the problem I try develop a user profile. I don't always go as far as to develop user stories, but I start to think about the user's motives.</p>
						<p>In the end I have 8 to 10 statements about the users. </p>

						<h2>Step Two: Wireframes</h2>
						<h3>User events</h3>
						<h3>Initial sketches</h3>
						<h3>Project map</h3>
						<p>"One thing I picked up over recent years that it's very tempting to try and sell your ideas to stakeholders by making the material look good. It should be clear, but it should be easily criticised and invite comments. Adding too much polish at this stage can start to win people over rather than inviting them to look-under-the-hood and and judge the concept rather than the execution."</p>
