				<p>Developing a winning mobile experience has always been a challenge on our AT&amp;T U-verse<sup>&reg;</sup> business. At the time, over 60% of our traffic came from mobile users. However, whenever we tested a mobile experience in which users were given a mobile-specific experience they overwhelmingly chose the 'view desktop' option.</p>

						<h1>Winning the War on Mobile</h1>
						<p>So how do we get a mobile experience to win? Previous attempts at getting a mobile-specific landing page win were hampered by taking the desktop layout and cutting it down to its most essential elements. In the end, the outcome was a hero image with a series of full-width buttons below it. Not a great solution.</p>

						<p>Our team took a more holistic approach to solving the problem. We identified key characteristcs that we wanted our mobile experience to have. First, it was critical to have a sticky header that kept the click to call button within reach at all times. Second, we wanted to have links to the plans page on the home page. Offering an easy way to get to the transactional part of the site was a must. Third, the site had to feel like it was created by mobile users for mobile users instead of feeling like a desktop experience shoe-horned into a mobile layout. Fourth, the pricing grid on the plans page needed to allow users to compare plans side-by-side.</p>

						<p>What you see below is a result of the design team's brainstorm sessions. I helped lead the discussion during those sessions and helped drive the overall strategy of the project. I sketched these wireframes as well, and yes, I know I have bad penmanship. Sorry. </p>

						<h2>Coding Considerations</h2>
						<p>From start to finish, this project was a lot of fun. I love design and strategy, but from a coding perspective this project was extraordinarily rewarding. Not being restricted by older browsers and being unleashed from the burden of backwards compatibility allowed me to try some new things. The card flip animation on the plans page was done using CSS3 transforms and Javascript.</p>

						<p>The slide drawer navigation effect was also created using CSS3 transitions and Javascript. I also got the chance to create mobile-specific touch effects on the nav links. You can't see it in the screenshots, but clicking on navigation links in the menu generated a ripple effect on touch events.</p>

						<p>I always challenge myself to create something special whenever I code a project, but being able to focus on modern browsers made it so much more exciting this time. It was great to use new units like vw and vh.</p>
