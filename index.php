				<p>I helped drive the design and product strategy for all of these projects, often working directly with a team of project managers, content writers and business development experts. On the non-IBM projects, I did the front end development and visual design all while <a href="design-leadership.php">leading</a> and <a href="design-mentorship.php">mentoring</a> a team of designers.</p>
				<p>Each project in my portfolio lists the skills, technologies, and resonsibilities I brought to that particular initiative. I hope you like what you see. <b>Enjoy!</b></p>

								<p>I've been in the industry since 2007 and taught myself design and front end development back before code camps and Google Chrome were a thing &mdash; back when we all had the title “web designer”. Nowadays, I spend my time leading and mentoring designers of all ages and abilities.</p>
								<p>As a design leader I work directly with product leadership at every level: product managers, development managers, and c-suite executives. I build and manage those relationships and work with leadership to strategize and drive the product roadmap. I work with my design teams to deliver excellent user experiences for our users and to advocate for the user at ever stage of the process.</p>
								<p>Being in design leatdership puts me right where I want to be. I'm at the intersection of product design, product strategy, and product management, and I get the opportunity to mentor folks along the way.</p> 
								<p>When I'm not leading my product team, I'm planning and facilitating design thinking workshops either through IBM or my local AIGA chapter. I've led workshops of all types and sizes, from Intro to Design Thinking to remote product team sessions with folks spread all around the world.</p>

Hard working, loyal, and dedicated, he sets goals, keeps his eye on the ball, and adapts as needed to get himself and his team across the finish line. He has been one of my favorite people to work with and mentor in my career and I would be excited to have him as a teammate on any project I am working on.</blockquote>
