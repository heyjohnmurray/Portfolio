				<p>Design Thinking is popular these days, but reading about it and putting it into practice are two different things. Scaling it at one of the largest companies in the world is a completely different beast altogether. Nevertheless, I've played an active role in scaling the design thinking discipline across IBM, not just across design but throughout the product management and development organizations as well.</p>

								<h4>"Build Experiences not Features" Webinar by Mural</h4>
								<b>Description</b>
								<p>If you’ve ever been frustrated at the lack of tangible takeaways following a design workshop, you’re not alone. Many teams find that design thinking workshops don’t often lead to real product improvements. It looks a little like the game of telephone: the team leaves the workshop in agreement, but before they can get back to work, things quickly get distorted or disappear altogether. At MURAL, we refer to this as workshop amnesia.</p>
								<p>The good news is there’s a solution. We recently welcomed <a href="https://twitter.com/heyjohnmurray">John Murray</a>, Design Team Lead &amp; Advisory Front End Developer at IBM, and <a href="https://twitter.com/ericmorrow">Eric Morrow</a>, Design Facilitator at IBM and author of Lean Accelerator, to host a webinar and share how they get around the persistent gaps. Through trial and error, they’ve discovered that teams can bridge the space between design workshops ideas and the product development that follows.</p>
								<p>They connect the two by using a method known as User Story Mapping.

								<blockquote class="curly-quotes">John is a rockstar. I haven't always had the pleasure of working with someone who I can always trust to bring their A­-game and hold me accountable to do the same. John is an awesome manager of things, leader of others, and do­er, maker, thinker and honestly my only regret is that we have never worked together on a team. If we did ­it would be the best team, ever. In the work we did together for AIGA, John came in as a volunteer and came out a mentor of many and leader of all. All I needed was a facilitator and what I got was much more. I think that is evidence of his ability to restlessly reinvent through feedback, unite and get it done now through his willingness to roll his sleeves up and do the work or lead, delegate, and mentor others so that they get a chance to practice what John preaches. He also shares his successes with his teammates and others who supported the great outcomes he is attached to.</blockquote>

								<h4>"Design Thinking at Scale" sponsored by AIGA Orange County</h4>
								<b>Description</b>
								<p>Design thinking is everywhere these days. There’s plenty of people telling you how to do it and how it works, but not enough people are talking about the practical application. How do I apply it? How do I actually do it? How do I get it to work at my company and with my team?</p>
								<p>In this session, sponsored by AIGA Orange County, I showed attendees how to implement design thinking practices in their companies. I gave them hands-on guidance and shared my personal experiences doing design thinking at IBM in Austin, TX.</p>
								<p>There were about 60 attendees in this all-day workshop, and I was the only facilitator, which meant I explained the exercise, then I walked around and made sure all four groups were on track and understood the objectives. While I'll admit that I was exhausted at the end of the day, it was an incredible experience. I loved watching folks embrace the possibilities and opportunities for bringing design thinking to their workplace.</p>

										<b>Description</b>
										<p>In April 2017, I was a support facilitator for the first of a multi-city collaborative workshop series for AIGA chapter leaders. Because space was limited for the workshop, 30 slots in all, there were a few attendee requirements as well as an application process:</p>
										<ul class="list">
											<li>Attendees must have an introductory knowledge/practice of design thinking</li>
											<li>Attendees must be an active AIGA Board Member, National Staff, or Advisory Board Member</li>
											<li>Attendees must be able to commit the two full days for the workshop - no phone, no email, just be present and engage fully in the experience</li>
										</ul>
										<p>The workshop focused on teaching attendees everything they needed to know to begin their journey into design thinking facilitation. With that knowledge, they were expected to go back to their local AIGA chapters and teach their members how to do design thinking. IBM felt this was the best way to empower and scale design thinking to AIGA's members.</p>
										<p>The attendees were broken up into groups, about 6 and as the support facilitator I coached two of the six groups throughout the workshop. Not only was I a hands-on instructor, I was able to share my design thinking experience with everyone who attended. I wanted to ground their theoretical process in a real-world perspective.</p>

						<h2>Design Thinking at IBM</h2>
						<h4>Swift Product Team Hills Workshop</h4>
						<img src="/assets/images/design-thinking/swift-workshop-team-photo-wide.jpg" alt="">
						<hr>
						<p><small>Originally written by Peter Perceval, IBM Swift Team Senior Visual Designer and <br/>Eric Morrow, design thinking facilitator, and posted on the IBM Hybrid Cloud Design blog.</small></p>
						<p>I was hired as an industry hire on July 11th 2016. A week later I would be deployed to a team that was still in the process of being created. A week after that we were officially the new design team for a brand new Hallmark project: Swift @ IBM.</p>
						<p>Our team was composed of three individuals: myself (Peter Perceval) and Clay Crenshaw, both brand new to IBM as industry hires, and our fearless team lead John Murray, who was coming from Bluemix and being deployed to Cloud Integration Design to lead his first team into uncharted territory. Charles, our researcher, joined a few weeks later.&nbsp; I wasn’t sure exactly how we were going to navigate this ship or what my exact role and contributions would be, but one thing I knew from the beginning was that in 2 months we were supposed to have a workshop with our stakeholders and come out of it with Hills.</p>
						<p>It would be a vast understatement to say this was a daunting, intimidating and nebulous task. We had to meet everyone involved in the five product offerings of Swift, learn the ins and outs of the offerings and the language, produce designs, and then also come up with a workshop to produce actionable hills for a high visibility project that is the linchpin to Apple and IBM’s relationship. While I may have been uncertain of many things, there was one thing I had faith in: the principles of design thinking. But how do I ensure that our stakeholders gain value from design thinking and not just see it as a waste of time?</p>
						<h5>The User goes in the middle. And the road to the middle is paved with research.</h5>
						<p>Our main goal was to have everyone who attended the workshop truly benefit from their participation. We began preparing for the Hills workshop by learning about the product and doing research about our User. We spent weeks collecting data and information in regards to Swift users. We performed dozens of interviews and surveys to understand their needs and empathize with their pains. Then we synthesized that information and began to design the workshop, agenda, and goals.</p>
						<p>We were a little nervous to see how things would play out the first day of the workshop. One of the major hurdles we had to cross was overall team alignment between our offerings and our user. We began the workshop with some breakfast and warmup exercises and then dove into a brief explanation of what IBM Design Thinking is. From that we split into three teams and began with empathy maps. Our empathy maps were a core part of the workshop and would undergo multiple iterations over the two days. We followed up our first exercise with user research findings and presented it to the team at large. Glancing around the room I could see hints of intrigue and excitement written across peoples’ faces and that they were gaining value from our insights and data. We layered in the user research over the empathy maps we had previously worked on.</p>
						<p>I knew we had hit a milestone when one of our most skeptical engineering leads expressed his excitement and apologized for any negative thoughts he had held prior to the workshop about design thinking. What was even more exciting was that many of these people had been in some form of IBM Design Thinking workshop or educational experience and still held skepticism prior to the workshop. Seeing first hand that skepticism turn to appreciation, alignment present itself, and value start to grow was extremely rewarding. After fleshing out our user personas and coming to agreement on their attributes, we ended the first day with some ideation before going to happy hour.</p>
						<h5>Back for more: From User Needs to Hills!</h5>
						<p>Day two got off to a slow start as the first two hours found us backtracking on some of our findings from the previous day. There is always iteration. The loop is one of my favorite design thinking elements because I think it is the most authentic, and visually and effectively explains the ever evolving process of design thinking. Often times people think that design thinking exercises are somewhat silly and redundant. I don’t see redundancies; instead they are constant iterations that provide clarity. They are exercises that allow you get more and more granular and extract the most important information. To scope your focus, build alignment, and work together as a team. It’s not easy having so many brilliant and vastly different people locked in a room with nothing but coffee, sharpies, and post it notes, but the results and benefits that come out of that room are exponential and invaluable. There were moments I wasn’t sure we would get hills but in the end we came out with not only 4 new hills but a number of new friends and a direction we could all navigate Swift @ IBM towards. I look forward to our future workshops and getting everyone back together to reiterate and explore our ideas even further.</p>
						<h5>Hill Formation in Action</h5>
						<p>Here’s a short video of one of the hills being crafted.</p>

						<h4>Wash, Rinse and Repeat (by Eric Morrow)</h4>
						<h5>Wash &mdash; Clean up the challenge before starting in</h5>
						<p>Design Thinking workshops should have a central challenge that they are trying to address. Working in an organization like IBM, where there are almost endless problems to tackle, a workshop needs a specific focus to avoid going off track.</p>
						<p>In planning this workshop, the Design team spoke with many representative members of OM and Development and settled on the challenge “How might we deliver an exceptional Swift offering to enterprise developers in time for Interconnect 2017?” (Workshop was in September 2016, Interconnect happens in March 2017).</p>
						<p>An excellent hygiene method to use when starting a workshop is abstraction laddering, to make sure the people in the room agree about what they are doing there. You put the challenge in the center of the whiteboard and ask the room to answer “Why” we should do that challenge over the timeframe of the workshop. Asking why makes the challenge more abstract. Then you ask “How” we should do the challenge. This makes it more tactical. Then you ask if anyone thinks any of the answers to Why or How are better areas to focus on during the workshop. Deceptively simple but devastatingly powerful, since most of the participants in a workshop might not be entirely clear what specific problem they are meant to be working on. After doing this method, the entire group should be clear about what they are trying to accomplish and have voiced any reasons to focus on something else.</p>
						<h5>Rinse – Check old assumptions against new evidence</h5>
						<p>Primary user research is the fuel that drives the Design Thinking “Observe-Reflect-Make” Restless Reinvention engine. And OM and Development can end up pretty far from the primary user in their day to day roles. So Design teams include a design researcher who can have direct contact and conversations with the primary user (who can evolve to become a Sponsor User). I did a modified (blank) empathy map exercise with the group to pull out their existing perspective on the user and then grouped the responses. Through that process we went from understanding our user as an enterprise developer to understanding the differences between a “traditional” and a “modern” enterprise developer. Since Swift is a new offering, we decided to aim at the modern enterprise developer, who we thought more likely to try something new. As we layered in research findings from our researcher, Charles, we found that we needed to split our modern enterprise developer again, into a client side/front end developer and a server side/back end developer. We affectionately called these users Billie and Ted(‘s excellent adventure!)</p>
						<h5>Repeat – Do an activity again if needed to get to the right result</h5>
						<p>We ended Day 1 of the two day workshop with Need Statements and a quick bout of ideation for a gut check. We started Day 2 with playbacks of how we created all the artifacts on Day 1. We decided that our user needs weren’t focused enough so we had a conversation and re-did them around a specific use case. One of the key mindsets of Design Thinking is iteration – that all the work that goes into creating an artifact is to advance the team’s agenda, not to create the specific artifact. We use Sharpies and Post-Its and Flipcharts so that it is cheap and easy to throw artifacts, and the work they represent, away. And yet, how often do we really re-do a specific method in a workshop? It is far better to repeat a method that didn’t advance the team then to proceed with a bad foundation. Once we re-wrote the needs, we were able to march on to Hills!</p>
