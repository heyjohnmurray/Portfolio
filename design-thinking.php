				<p>Design Thinking is popular these days, but reading about it and putting it into practice are two different things. Scaling it at one of the largest companies in the world is a complete beast altogether. Nevertheless, I've played an active role in scaling the design thinking discipline across IBM's design culture. But I'm most proud of the impact I've had on our product management and development organizations as well.</p>

						<blockquote class="curly-quotes">John is a rockstar. I haven't always had the pleasure of working with someone who I can always trust to bring their A­-game and hold me accountable to do the same. John is an awesome manager of things, leader of others, and do­er, maker, thinker and honestly my only regret is that we have never worked together on a team. If we did ­it would be the best team, ever. In the work we did together for AIGA, John came in as a volunteer and came out a mentor of many and leader of all. All I needed was a facilitator and what I got was much more. I think that is evidence of his ability to restlessly reinvent through feedback, unite and get it done now through his willingness to roll his sleeves up and do the work or lead, delegate, and mentor others so that they get a chance to practice what John preaches. He also shares his successes with his teammates and others who supported the great outcomes he is attached to.</blockquote>
