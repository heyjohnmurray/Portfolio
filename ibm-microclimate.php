						<h2>Microclimate and the Developer Experience</h2>
						<h4>The Mission</h4>
						<p>In August 2017, I was assigned to the newly-formed Hybrid Cloud Developer Experience tribe. For anyone who's ever gotten in on the ground floor of any new business initiative, you know that even when there's a stated mission, it can be tricky to know where to being and what to prioritize.</p>
						<p>Whenever I work with a new set of stakeholders I seek to clarify the mission first and foremost. I do that by identifying at least one key stakeholder as my "source of truth". Sometimes that's the executive in charge, sometimes it's an architect or a member of the product team leadership. For me, it's all about figuring out who has the clearest idea of the product's vision and strategy and working with them to get alignment and shared understanding from the rest of the leadership team.</p>
						<p>After a few weeks of user research, stakeholder interviews, and competitive landscape analysis; we presented our findings to our leadership team as a way to reiterate and validate what we felt were the objectives so that we could move forward.</p>
						<p>Based on the generative research we showed in that presentation, our leadership team agreed on a three-pronged mission. With the mission defined, we began to chart our course.</p>
						
						<h4>Want to see more?</h4>
						<p>Like any product that is in production and going through iterative improvements, I can't openly share the details of our UX process or show in-flight design work. If you'd like to see more detail then email me, and I'll grant you access. If you already have login information then click "View this project!" in the sidebar to login.</p>
