				<p>Microclimate is an end to end development environment that lets you rapidly create, edit, and deploy applications. Applications are run in containers from day one and can be delivered into production on Kubernetes through an automated DevOps pipeline using Jenkins. Microclimate can be installed locally or on IBM Cloud Private.</p>

						<h2>Microclimate and the Developer Experience</h2>
						<h4>The Challenge</h4>
						<p>In August 2017, I was assigned to the newly-formed Hybrid Cloud Developer Experience tribe. For anyone who's ever gotten in on the ground floor of any new business initiative, you know that even when there's a stated mission, it can be tricky to know where to begin and what to prioritize.</p>
						<!-- <p>Whenever I work with a new set of stakeholders I seek to clarify the mission first and foremost. I do that by identifying at least one key stakeholder as my "source of truth". Sometimes that's the executive in charge, sometimes it's an architect or a member of the product team leadership. For me, it's all about figuring out who has the clearest idea of the product's vision and strategy and working with them to get alignment and shared understanding from the rest of the leadership team.</p> -->

						<h5>New team, no product roadmap</h5>
						<!-- <p>As a design lead at IBM, I've been in this position many times before. In fact, I often tell people that working at IBM is like working in a startup incubator. Projects come and projects go. With each one you learn a little more than the time before.</p> -->
						<p>Oftentimes, product management is moving so fast trying to get everything up and running that they simply don't have time to create a thought-out product roadmap. In some cases, it's in their heads but it hasn't been documented. This isn't new for me.</p>
						<p>No one in product management or development had worked with a multi-disciplinary design team.</p>
						<hr>

						<h5>Similar but different products merged into one</h5>
						<p>The tribe leadership wanted to create a development IDE that gave users a turn-key solution for creating microservice-based applications. To do that, they took teams that had been working separately but on similar work and made them the Developer Experience Tribe.</p>
						<p>The three teams included:</p>

						<ol class="list">
							<li>Microservice builder - a "getting started" tool to help developers ease into creating microservice-architected cloud applications.</li>
							<li>IDE-in-a-box - a development environment that allows users to create cloud native applications, regardless of what language they choose.</li>
							<li>MSCP - a cloud platform created by a team we had in China and based on open source technology</li>
						</ol>
						<hr>

						<h5>Immovable Deadlines</h5>
						<p>In our first two releases we had deadlines that couldn't be pushed back.</p>

						<ol class="list">
							<li>Beta needed to be released in early January so our sales force could promote and demo the product.</li>
							<li>GA needed to be released in time for THINK, IBM's annual customer and client engagement conference.</li>
						</ol>
						<hr>

						<h5>New design team</h5>
						<p>A new design team was formed for this product. None of us had ever worked together, and we had no established UX process.</p>

						<h2>The Mission</h2>
						<p>While we waited for all of the development resources to be allocated, the design team needed to hit the ground running.</p>
						<p>I specifically needed to:</p>
						<ol class="list">
							<li>Get alignment from stakeholders on the team's mission</li>
							<li>Gather technical domain knowledge and onboard my designers</li>
							<li>Identify a user persona and begin validating who the intended user was</li>
							<li>Work with product management to define an ad hoc product roadmap</li>
						</ol>

						<h4>The Process</h4>
						<p>Like any product that is in production and going through iterative improvements, I can't openly share the details of our UX process or show in-flight design work. If you'd like to see more detail then email me, and I'll grant you access. If you already have login information then click "Read the case study!" in the sidebar to login.</p>
