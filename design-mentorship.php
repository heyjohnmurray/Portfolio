				<div class="headline"><span>Design</span> Mentorship</div>
				<p>I think mentorship is an under-rated attribute of true leadership. Most people think of a leader as someone who gives directions, goes to meetings, and assigns tasks. While those things are true in some sense, I see mentorship as an extension of leadership and one of the most effective ways to create future leaders and effective employees.</p>
				<p>My mentorship strategy is simple: <i>Be the mentor you wish you had when you were starting out.</i></p>

						<blockquote class="curly-quotes">John pushed me to be the best version of myself when I felt the most insecure in my career. He has mentored me from a timid designer full of fear to a confident leader. Over the past few years he has been the one person who I could turn to with questions that would give me the brutal and honest truth. Even after he moved and we were no longer able to talk face to face the advice, friendship and guidance has not stopped.</blockquote>

						<hr />
						<p>I met Andrew in 2013 when he was assigned to be the junior designer on my Red Ventures Insurance design team. We bonded over our shared music interests from back when we were in high school. Andrew was one of the first people I actively mentored in my career. Before that time I felt like I was just a kid with little wisdom to impart to anyone, but since I was expected to develop him I put aside my insecurities and did the best I could to help him grow technically and professionally.</p>
						<p>We worked together for the next two years until I left the company to come work at IBM. Even though I left we stayed in touch and regularly discussed career growth and ambitions he had and talked about what he could be doing to attain them.</p>
						<p>When Andrew first joined the company he came in as a junior designer and now he's a design team lead with his own direct reports. It's been incredible to watch him grow in his career and see him become a confident leader. He's lightyears removed from the timid young designer I met years ago, and it's incredible to know that I had a hand in his development.</p>

						<p>In March 2017, I was scrolling through the IBM Design public Slack channels and saw someone request help seeking a mentor. At the time I didn't think much of it. I took a minute to reach out to Camila and introduce myself, and we arranged to video chat later the next week.</p>

								<p>During our first conversation I found out that she was an aspiring UX designer working in one of IBM's offices in Brazil. She told me she was interested in breaking into the industry professionally but didn't really know where to start. She'd read some books, taken some introductory classes, but she wanted a mentor who could help push her in the right direction.</p>
								<p>As soon as she said she was inexperienced and looking to get started I thought back to when I was first started out. I recognized her curiosity and ambition, and I knew I wanted to help.</p>
								<p>Over the course of the next six months I coached her in the principles of UX and we established a consistent meeting time.</p>
								<p>She would show me her recent design projects. I'd provide feedback and give her clues as to potential next steps and we'd set a time to meet again. By the end of the six months she was taking on side projects from development teams in her office that didn't have design resources and growing into a solid junior designer in her own right.</p>
