						<h4>The First 30 Days</h4>
						<p>As you read on the <a href="/ibm-microclimate.php">previous page</a> my team faced a number of hurdles early on including:</p>
						<ol class="list">
							<li>Get alignment from stakeholders on the team's mission</li>
							<li>Gather technical domain knowledge and onboard my designers</li>
							<li>Work with product management to define an ad hoc product roadmap</li>
							<li>Identify a user persona and begin validating our team's assumptions about who the intended user was</li>
						</ol>

						<h5>Aligning on and defining our mission</h5>
						<p>With any new project I lead, I look for consistency and guidance from the leadership around me. I usually look for a "visionary" or "source of truth", someone who I think has the clearest understanding of the overall objective and the direction things should be heading. In this case, it was my executive sponsor. I met with him and asked him questions including:</p>
						<ul class="list">
							<li>What does success for this product team look like to you?</li>
							<li>What do <b>you</b> think our objective is?</li>
							<li>Who do <b>you</b> think our target user(s) should be?</li>
							<li>What do you see as the product team's goals in the next 30, 60, and 90 days?</li>
						</ul>

						<p>After the initial meeting, I set up similar meetings with key members of our tribe leadership to ask them the same questions. Then, I circled back around to our executive sponsor and shared my impressions of what I heard so that he can clarify things for me and also tell me when someone was right or wrong. I've found that the sooner you can identify inconsistent perceptions among stakeholders the better.</p>

						<h5>Hitting the books</h5>
						<p>As the design lead I feel I need to know the most about the product so that I can answer any questions my team may have. Because our product requires a strong technical background I read everything I could about the following:</p>
						<div class="row">
							<div class="column small-12 medium-6">
								<ul class="list">
									<li>microservices</li>
									<li>Java frameworks</li>
									<li>Docker</li>
									<li>Kubernetes</li>
									<li>containers</li>
								</ul>
							</div>
							<div class="column small-12 medium-6">
								<ul class="list">
									<li>containerization</li>
									<li>virtualization</li>
									<li>devops tooling</li>
									<li>container management frameworks</li>
									<li>container management platforms</li>
								</ul>
							</div>
						</div>

						<p>After I read everything I could get my hands on I set up daily knowledge sharing meetings with my design team to explain what I'd learned and to assign them a topic to go out and do further investigation on to share with the group.</p>
						<p>Despite our constant knowledge sharing, some folks were still struggling to make heads or tails of the rather dense subject matter. Understandable, so I created a document diagraming everything I knew and walked them through it.</p>
						
						<p><img src="/assets/images/screenshots/ibm-microclimate/process/knowledge-gathering.png" alt=""></p>
						<p><img src="/assets/images/screenshots/ibm-microclimate/process/knowledge-gathering2.png" alt=""></p>
						
						<p>As we were learning about the domain and meeting with stakeholders, I wanted to be open with my team about what we knew, what we didn't know, and what we were afraid to ask.</p>

						<h5>Defining the tribe's mission</h5>
						<p>[intro paragraph about balancing the strategic and the tactical]</p>

						<p>In the end we worked together to develop a three-pronged mission:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Create a tool or set of tools that developers that was valuable to developers</li>
							<li>Use that product to generate interest in the IBM Cloud Platform at large</li>
							<li>Nurture and maintain that interest by ramping up developer advocacy</li>
						</ol>
						
						
						[reference the initial kickoff deck]
						<p>After a few weeks of user research, stakeholder interviews, and competitive landscape analysis; we presented our findings to our leadership team as a way to reiterate and validate what we felt were the objectives so that we could move forward.</p>
						<p>Based on the generative research we showed in that presentation, our leadership team agreed on a three-pronged mission. With the mission defined, we began to chart our course.</p>

			<h5>Establishing the design team's mandate and intent</h5>
			<p>As a traditionally developer-led organization, IBM Design has been given an emphatic mandate to change the developer-as-the-end-user culture that has consumed the company and hindered its progress. This was the first time that we had the leadership for design, product management, and development all in the same room. To be totally honest, my VP of design and I went into the meeting knowing we had to play a little bit of good cop/bad cop. So you'll see slides essentially saying: "here's what we're here to do and this isn't business as usual where you can put unfair expectations on the design team without considering them in the product strategy.</p>
