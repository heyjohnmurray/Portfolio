						<h4>The First 30 Days</h4>
						<p>As you read on the <a href="/ibm-microclimate.php">previous page</a> my team faced a number of hurdles early on including:</p>
						<ol class="list">
							<li>Get alignment from stakeholders on the team's mission</li>
							<li>Gather technical domain knowledge and onboard my designers</li>
							<li>Identify a user persona and begin validating who the intended user was</li>
							<li>Work with product management to define an ad hoc product roadmap</li>
						</ol>
						
						<hr>

						<h5>Aligning on and defining our mission</h5>
						<p>With any new project I lead, I look for consistency and guidance from the leadership around me. I usually look for a "visionary" or "source of truth", someone who I think has the clearest understanding of the overall objective and the direction things should be heading. In this case, it was my executive sponsor. I met with him and asked him questions including:</p>
						<ul class="list">
							<li>What does success for this product team look like to you?</li>
							<li>What do <b>you</b> think our objective is?</li>
							<li>Who do <b>you</b> think our target user(s) should be?</li>
							<li>What do you see as the product team's goals in the next 30, 60, and 90 days?</li>
						</ul>

						<p>After the initial meeting, I set up similar meetings with key members of our tribe leadership to ask them the same questions. Then, I circled back around to our executive sponsor and shared my impressions of what I heard so that he can clarify things for me and also tell me when someone was right or wrong. I've found that the sooner you can identify inconsistent perceptions among stakeholders the better.</p>
						<p>By meeting with stakeholders and documenting the discussion we were able to develop a three-pronged mission for our product team:</p>
						<ol class="list">
							<li>Create a tool or set of tools that developers that was valuable to developers</li>
							<li>Use that product to generate interest in the IBM Cloud Platform at large</li>
							<li>Nurture and maintain that interest by ramping up developer advocacy</li>
						</ol>
						
						<hr>

						<h5>Hitting the books</h5>
						<p>As the design lead I feel I need to know the most about the product so that I can answer any questions my team may have. Because our product requires a strong technical background I read everything I could about the following:</p>
						<div class="row">
							<div class="column small-12 medium-6">
								<ul class="list">
									<li>microservices</li>
									<li>Java frameworks</li>
									<li>Docker</li>
									<li>Kubernetes</li>
									<li>containers</li>
								</ul>
							</div>
							<div class="column small-12 medium-6">
								<ul class="list">
									<li>containerization</li>
									<li>virtualization</li>
									<li>devops tooling</li>
									<li>container management frameworks</li>
									<li>container management platforms</li>
								</ul>
							</div>
						</div>
					
						<hr>

						<div class="row column small-12">
							<h5>Onboarding and level-setting as a team</h5>
							<p>After I read everything I could get my hands on I set up daily knowledge sharing meetings with my design team to explain what I'd learned and to assign them a topic to go out and do further investigation on to share with the group.</p>
							<p>Despite our constant knowledge sharing, some folks were still struggling to make heads or tails of the rather dense subject matter. Understandable, so I created a document diagraming everything I knew and walked them through it.</p>
							<p>One of the hardest parts about being a leader in these situations is sharing what you know at the same rate at which you're learning it. To help me with that I also diagrammed the ongoing business strategy and a 30/60/90 outlook for the design team so they didn't feel out-of-the-loop.</p>
							
							<p><img src="/assets/images/screenshots/ibm-microclimate/process/knowledge-gathering.png" alt=""></p>
							<p><img src="/assets/images/screenshots/ibm-microclimate/process/knowledge-gathering2.png" alt=""></p>
							
							<p>As we were learning about the domain and meeting with stakeholders, I wanted to be open with my team about what we knew, what we didn't know, and what we were afraid to ask.</p>
							<p><img src="/assets/images/screenshots/ibm-microclimate/process/questions-and-assumptions.png" alt=""></p>

							<small><i>At the time the product only had a working name, Microclimate, so I was just calling it "TBD Offering".</i></small>

							<hr>

							<h5>Defining the user</h5>
							<p>While I was learning and sharing with my team, I worked with our researcher to do some initial surveys and developer interviews.</p>
							
							<p>We asked a number of questions including:</p>
							<ul class="list">
								<li>How do developers discover, try and buy new tooling?</li>
								<li>What traits do they value most when evaluating new tooling?</li>
								<li>Where does IBM stand in the developer community?</li>
								<li>Are developers brand loyal to any single cloud platform?</li></li>
							</ul>

							<p>Here's a summary of those early research findings:</p>
							<iframe src="//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/pvsKgcoHFZF8iC" width="595" height="485" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" style="border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;" allowfullscreen></iframe>

							<p>While we were doing surveys and interviews, we looked at personas we may have inherited with the three products that were merging to form our new product team. Microservice Builder had a couple of personas, and after some discussions with our stakeholders settled on Rohan, the devops developer.</p>
							<p>We chose Rohan because he was validated by previous researchers on our design org and because he matched the non-traditional IBM customer our stakeholders had in mind.</p>

							<h5>Rohan, the devops developer</h5>
							<small>Summary</small>
							<p>Rohan works in a smaller company in a medium size city. His role as a developer requires him to wear many hats managing both the customer facing applications and operations for the company. His skills are similar to Maureen (Developer) but their differing work environments and team structure means they have unique needs.</p>

							<small>Goals</small>
							<ul class="list">
								<li>Create, deploy and manage applications and microservices</li>
								<li>Find affordable tools and services to simplify his operations workflow</li>
							</ul>

							<small>Behaviors</small>
							<ul class="list">
								<li>Actively participates in local professional groups and meetups</li>
								<li>Brings his work home with him</li>
							</ul>

							<small>Beliefs</small>
							<ul class="list">
								<li>He'd rather pay for a service to maintain an app so he can focus on the app</li>
								<li>Open source is great</li>
							</ul>

							<small>Needs</small>
							<ul class="list">
								<li>To find affordable tools and services to simplify his operations workflow</li>
								<li>Guidance for cloud native best practices</li>
							</ul>

							<h5>Creating an ad hoc product roadmap</h5>
							<p>My product manager never had time to create a product roadmap in the early days. And there's nothing worse than trying to create something when you don't know the long-term strategy.</p>
							<p>When I realized we weren't going to get a product roadmap anytime soon, I took it upon myself to create a living document of our end-to-end experience. I felt like if I had a sense of the current as-is scenario then I could show it to my stakeholders and have them prioritize what parts we want to fill in as we go along. Since it's a living document that I update, it has served as the ad hoc roadmap that I need.</p>
							<p>Take a look:</p>
							<p><img src="/assets/images/screenshots/ibm-microclimate/process/as-is-scenario.png" alt=""></p>
							<p>The image above is a zoomed in view of the end-to-end as-is scenario that I created early on and that I use as a proxy for a product roadmap. It allows me to keep my finger on the pulse of what's going on.</p>
							<p><img src="/assets/images/screenshots/ibm-microclimate/process/as-is-scenario-gap.png" alt=""></p>
							<p>In the image above you'll see a box with a dotted border. That's where I highlighted that we're missing functionality. By mapping out the end-to-end in this manner, I can objectively show our stakeholders where there are gaps in our product.</p>

						<h4>Design Kickoff</h4>
						<p>After weeks of user research, stakeholder interviews, and competitive landscape analysis; we presented our findings to our leadership team as a way to reiterate and validate what we felt were the objectives so that we could move forward.</p>
						<p>Based on the generative research we showed in that presentation, our leadership team agreed that we need to focus on adding core functionality to the beta release, particularly focusing on "Getting Started".</p>
						<p>Here's the two-part presentation we gave that day. The first one is the overall presentation, and the second is, once again, the summary of the research findings.</p>

						<h4>Beta Release - January 15, 2018</h4>
						<p>After we were aligned with stakeholders and agreed that the beta release needed to focus on "Getting Started", we dug deeper. After having meetings and working sessions, we agreed that a wizard-style project creation flow was the best experience. Users needed to be able to come in and create a microservice-based application quickly and easily.</p>
						<p>Originally, our product was going to be non-IBM branded so as to appeal to developers who might be wary of trying something that looked and felt like "Big Blue".</p>
						<p>Here are a few screenshots from our beta release:</p>

						<h4>GA Release - March 30, 2018</h4>
						<p>As we were releasing our beta in January, we began planning for our Q1 deliverable. The emphasis for this release was on having a compelling story that we could demo on stage at THINK in March. This meant we had to be done with designs by mid-February. That didn't leave us a lot of wiggle room to do UX and visuals, but we got everything done in time and had a successful release.</p>
						<hr>
						<h5>Determining the scope for Q1</h5>
						<p>I wasn't really involved as deeply in the beta release discussion as I'd like&mdash;part of being in a development-led organization, unfortunately. So when it came time to plan the next release I was determined to make things better. Design needed to have a stronger voice in shaping the product and the experience.</p>
						<p>In the lead up to the session I met with our product manager and explained that doing a user story mapping activity could help us.</p>
						<p>Essentially we had a 2 hour slot in a single all-day planning meeting to do "design". It wasn't much, but I made the most of it. I didn't have a lot of time to do the pre-work I normally do for workshops so I kept my process simple:</p>
						<ol class="list">
							<li>Get product management buy-in</li>
							<li>Prepare a workshop agenda and <a href="/assets/images/screenshots/ibm-microclimate/process/q1-usm-session.png">Mural document</a></li>
							<li>Get a facilitator</li>
							<li>Show everyone the process and how it works</li>
							<li>Do a user story mapping session and see what comes out</li>
						</ol>
						<hr>
						<h5>Running the session</h5>
						<p>Normally, I don't like to teach a group how to do an exercise and get them to deliver an outcome all in the same workshop because it's asking too much. In this situation I didn't have the luxury to get the stakeholder buy-in I wanted.</p>
						<p>Here's the explanatory part of the workshop document:</p>
						<p><img src="/assets/images/screenshots/ibm-microclimate/process/q1-usm-session-intro-explanation.jpg" alt=""></p>
						<p>Then I showed them the persona and the hills, or mission statements, that they'd all seen for this release.</p>
						<p><img src="/assets/images/screenshots/ibm-microclimate/process/q1-usm-session-persona-hill-explanation.jpg" alt=""></p>
						<p>Next, I showed them the as-is flow that was currently in the product. If you remember earlier, I mentioned that I had an end-to-end experience document that I used as a proxy for a product roadmap. I referenced that to show the team the as-is you see below.</p>
						<p><img src="/assets/images/screenshots/ibm-microclimate/process/q1-usm-session-as-is.jpg" alt=""></p>
						<p>Finally, I showed them what a user story map could look like.</p>
						<p><img src="/assets/images/screenshots/ibm-microclimate/process/q1-usm-session-example.jpg" alt=""></p>
						<p>Then it was time to dig into the exercise itself, and the team started to look at the mission statement they'd written and create a to-be scenario of the ideal user experience.</p>
						<p><img src="/assets/images/screenshots/ibm-microclimate/process/q1-usm-session-ideation.jpg" alt=""></p>
						<p>What they created wasn't pretty, but in the end they created an end-to-end experience that represented something achievable within the upcoming release. They also started to add screenshots from competitor products that mirrored the experience they were creating. Before they knew it, the experience was coming to life, and the design team had something to go off of.</p>
						<p><img src="/assets/images/screenshots/ibm-microclimate/process/q1-usm-session-finished-map.jpg" alt=""></p>
						<p>Key takeaways from the experience:</p>
						<ol class="list">
							<li>Product management saw the value of mapping out an experience and were bought into the process. They were even eager to do it again!</li>
							<li>The as-is scenario had two potential routes the team could have explored, and doing user story mapping forced them to prioritize one path they wanted to deliver. In the end, they found a painless way to scope the release.</li>
							<li>Design walked away with two clear deliverables: create an import flow and a devops pipeline flow into the product.</li>
							<li>Design could start to do wireframes and early prototyping knowing that they were working on something that the product team had agreed on.</li>
						</ol>
						<hr>
						<h5>Storyboarding</h5>
						<p>With loose user stories from the sotry mapping session, I was able to write a user journey storyline that I shared with one of our designers, and he was able to begin to create a storyboard from what I shared with him.</p>

						<p><img src="/assets/images/screenshots/ibm-microclimate/process/usm-storyboards2.jpg" alt=""></p>
						<hr>
						<h5>Low-fi wireframes</h5>
						<p>With the stories defined, we began to create low-fi wireframes to further evolve the user journey as we understood it.</p>

						<p><img src="/assets/images/screenshots/ibm-microclimate/process/import-low-fi-wires3.jpg" alt=""></p>
						<hr>
						<h5>Hi-fi wireframes</h5>
						<p>Because we used a component library, we were able to go from low-fi wireframes to hi-fi design screens with ease.</p>
						<p><img src="/assets/images/screenshots/ibm-microclimate/process/import-hi-fi-wires1.jpg" alt=""></p>

						<hr>
						<h5>Product team pivots</h5>
						<p>Between beta and Q1 our leadership team had to make the difficult decision to make a more concerted effort to make our product look more closely integrated into the IBM Cloud Platform portfolio. Originally, we were supposed to be more ambitious and have an non-branded look and feel&mdash;"un-IBM", if you will. This pivot forced us to take a step back visually and adopt the <a href="http://carbondesignsystem.com/">Carbon Design System</a>. While it was frustrating to have to redo our visual design aesthetic for the next release, adopting a component library helped us speed up some of our design process. We weren't having to make UI elements from scratch and our developer was able to pull from the Carbon codebase and deliver into production much faster. It also neutralized the "design-by-committee" problem that we had going on in during the beta release.</p>

						<small>GA welcome screen</small>
						<p><img src="/assets/images/screenshots/ibm-microclimate/project-headshots/beta/welcome-get-started-ga.png" alt=""></p>
						
						<p>As you can see from just those two images alone, we had to go in a totally different direction between beta and GA in terms of our visual design.</p>

						<h4>Growing Pains and Learnings</h4>
						<p>As productive as our team has been in the six months since we've started working together, it hasn't been without its share of setbacks. Here's a brief list of things I've learned along the way.</p>
						
						<h5>Development restrictions impact design</h5>
						<p>You live and die by development's implementation schedule. No matter how much design work you hand over, if they hit an internal obstacle you may not see your work ship in the given release.</p>
						<p>Secondly, keep in mind that a portion of your design resources will be dedicated to overseeing developmental implementation. So even though you want to hand off and move on to working on the next release, you're still going to need to remain diligent. Otherwise, you'll run into inconsistencies between the designs and the finished, shipped product.</p>
					
						<hr>

						<h5>Shared alignment with stakeholders and remote teams</h5>
						<p>When you have remote teams, you can't bring folks in to do Google-style design sprints. That simply doesn't work at IBM. I've learned to break up design sprints into smaller remote collaboration and ideation sessions. Every session comes with a scheduled review meeting where the output is shared with the larger team.</p>
						<p><img src="/assets/images/screenshots/ibm-microclimate/process/ux-playback-process.png" alt=""></p>
						<small>Notice in the image above that there are "playback" meetings scheduled all along the way.</small>
						<hr>

						<h5>Establishing UX process is not instantaneous, it's progressive</h5>
						<p>I've <a href="https://medium.com/design-ibm/build-experiences-not-features-part-2-of-2-8d1c7ac523db">written extensively</a> on UX process and how to integrate design thinking with agile development. But showing the value of design and getting it a seat at the table take time. It's a slow and steady process and it's not something that is acheived in a single release or a single quarter. It's about refinement.</p>
						<p>In fact, my design team started out by having to meet short deadlines and didn't get to do as much ideation as we wanted, but over time we've been able to create the autonomy we need to explore. We definitely had growing pains with our stakeholders and with ourselves as a team.</p>
						<p>We were a textbook example of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuckman%27s_stages_of_group_development">Tuckman's stages of group development:</a></p>
						<ul class="list">
							<li>Forming - our beta release</li>
							<li>Storming - our GA release</li>
							<li>Norming - our current release</li>
							<li>Performing - our next release, hopefully</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Over time we've evolved our process to what you see below.</p>
						<p><img src="/assets/images/screenshots/ibm-microclimate/process/ux-process-v1.png" alt=""></p>
						<p><a href="/assets/images/screenshots/ibm-microclimate/process/ux-process-v1.png" class="button is-primary">Click to view artifact!</a></p>

						<p>Ideally, we're trying to evolve to something more efficient like what you see in this inforgraphic below. Slowly but surely we're getting there.</p>
						<p><img src="/assets/images/screenshots/ibm-microclimate/process/ux-process.jpg" alt=""></p>
						<small>I created the image above as part of a case study I did about how we can integrate design thinking and agile.</small>
						
						<hr>
						
						<h5>Be flexible in your communication</h5>
						<p>While I'm a firm believer in over-communication when necessary, sometimes that can get tiring. Learn to change things up when your communication isn't resonating with folks.</p>
						<p>Early on I was constantly being asked what design was going to deliver and when. Finally, I started to create a quarterly design brief in GitHub. I made it my top epic, and made all other epics dependencies of that parent epic. Then I shared out that link to the development leads and product management. Problem solved. Now I create a brief for every release and stakeholders have a better since of what my team is doing and delivering.</p>
						<p><img src="/assets/images/screenshots/ibm-microclimate/process/github-design-brief.png" alt=""></p>
						
						<hr>
						
						<h5>You have to avoiding an "us vs. them" mentality</h5>
						<p>It's all too easy to have an "us vs. them" mentality when you're dealing with team members on a multi-disciplinary product team. I've seen that type of negativity sink design's credibility all too often. I was so inspired by the idea that I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2ZEp2wuH_o">wrote and gave a talk about it</a> at the UX Design Summit in San Francisco in March 2018.</p>
						<p>My team struggled with that mentality at first, and that was the inspiration for this talk.</p>
