						<h2>Microclimate and the Developer Experience</h2>
						
						<h4>The Mission</h4>
						[reference the initial kickoff deck]
						<p>After a few weeks of user research, stakeholder interviews, and competitive landscape analysis; we presented our findings to our leadership team as a way to reiterate and validate what we felt were the objectives so that we could move forward.</p>
						<p>Based on the generative research we showed in that presentation, our leadership team agreed on a three-pronged mission. With the mission defined, we began to chart our course.</p>

						<p>As you read on the <a href="/ibm-microclimate.php">previous page</a> my team's first </p>

						<!-- <h5>Finding a visionary and solidifying the vision</h5>
						<p>As a design lead at IBM, I've been in this position many times before. In fact, I often tell people that working at IBM is like working in a startup incubator. Projects come and projects go. With each one you learn a little more than the time before.</p>
						<p>With that said, every product team I've led at IBM has been for an initiative that was starting at square one.</p> -->
