#Portfolio

This is my portfolio. It uses Foundation grid for the mobile-first responsive structure. I used lazy load and Foundation's Interchange plugin to get my images optimized so that the pages load fast and so mobile users' data isn't being eaten up.

Feel free to visit [the site itself](http://www.heyjohnmurray.us) or view my [resume](http://www.heyjohnmurray.us/JohnMurrayResume2015.pdf).

Enjoy!
